<!--
	The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate the use of a while or do-while loop.
	
	The computer has 3 items (5 of each) in its inventory.  As the Add Item button is clicked, those items are removed from inventory and added to a list of selected items.  The computer must be aware of which items have been selected so that it does not select an item it has run out of.

					The two can be used interchangeably with slight modifications to the code, but it's much easier to program a do...while if your loop needs to execute AT LEAST ONCE.  If there is a possibility your loop can be skipped entirely, stick with a while...
					
					When writing a loop, you need to determine your condition.  This may not be immediately apparent.  Sometimes, if you know you need a loop, coding the inside of the loop can give you clues about what the condition should be.  When do you want the loop to stop?
					
					Part of the code inside the loop must take the condition into account.  You must write code that can change the circumstances so that the condition eventually becomes false.  The infinite loop is the most common mistake when just starting out.
